# resNet50V2_intel-image-classification_sabafatima
Welcome to the GitHub project for the ResNet50v2 model run on the Intel Image Classification dataset!  

You can run this model easily on google colab with GPU. 

Little abput project:

This project aims to showcase the implementation and performance of the ResNet50v2 model on the Intel Image Classification dataset. The ResNet50v2 model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for image classification tasks. It is a variant of the original ResNet50V2 model with some modifications to the architecture that improve its accuracy and efficiency.

The Intel Image Classification dataset consists of images belonging to 6 classes, including mountains, sea, and buildings. The dataset is widely used for benchmarking image classification models and has a balanced distribution of images across the classes.

In this project,I have demonstrated how the ResNet50v2 model has been fine-tuned and improved to increase its accuracy on the Intel Image Classification dataset. We also provide a comparison of the model's performance over time, using a history graph to illustrate the improvement in accuracy.

Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the ResNet50v2 model and its capabilities on the Intel Image Classification dataset. 

I hope that the resources and insights shared in this project will be useful for researchers and practitioners working on similar image classification tasks.
